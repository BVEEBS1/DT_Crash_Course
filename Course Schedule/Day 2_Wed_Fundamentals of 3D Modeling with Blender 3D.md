#### Morning Session: Blender Interface and Basic Tools

1. **Blender Interface Overview**
   - Navigating the Blender workspace: understanding the layout, windows, and panels.
   - Customizing the interface to suit individual workflows.

2. **Basic 3D Modeling Tools**
   - Introduction to fundamental modeling tools: move, rotate, scale.
   - Understanding vertices, edges, and faces in 3D modeling.

3. **Creating Simple Shapes**
   - Practice creating basic shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders.
   - Learning to modify these shapes using extrusion, beveling, and subdivision.

4. **Introduction to the Modifier Stack**
   - Exploring simple modifiers like Mirror, Array, and Solidify.
   - Understanding how modifiers can streamline the modeling process.

#### Assignment (End of Day):

- **Task:** Create a 3D model of a household item using Blender. 
  - Select an item such as a lamp, chair, or coffee mug.
  - Focus on replicating the shape and proportions accurately.
  - Apply the basic transformations learned to position your model effectively in the 3D space.

The goal of this assignment is to apply the day's learning in a practical scenario, helping solidify the basic concepts of 3D modeling in Blender. This exercise also prepares participants for more complex modeling tasks required in digital twin development.
