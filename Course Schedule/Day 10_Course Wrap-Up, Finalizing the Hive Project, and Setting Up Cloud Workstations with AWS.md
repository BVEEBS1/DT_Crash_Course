#### Afternoon Session: Setting Up an AWS Cloud Workstation for NVIDIA Omniverse

1. **Overview of Omniverse Virtual Workstation**
   - An introduction to the Omniverse Virtual Workstation, which allows the creation or provisioning of a virtual machine with graphical capabilities on AWS【60†source】.

2. **Prerequisites for Setup**
   - Discussing the requirements for setting up the workstation, including an AWS account, a CloudFormation definition file provided by NVIDIA, and an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Omniverse【61†source】.

3. **Provisioning the Instance**
   - Step-by-step guidance on logging into the AWS account, navigating to the CloudFormation services dashboard, creating a stack with new resources, and specifying the template for the Omniverse Virtual Workstation【62†source】.

4. **Configuring the Stack**
   - Completing stack configuration options including tags, IAM role, and stack failure options【63†source】.

5. **Launching and Verifying the Instance**
   - Reviewing settings, submitting the configuration, and monitoring the status of the stack creation. Once the instance is provisioned, verifying it on the EC2 services dashboard【64†source】【65†source】.

6. **Connecting to the Instance**
   - Instructions on installing and connecting to the instance using the NICE DCV client application. This includes entering the Hostname/IP Address and logging in with the initial credentials【66†source】.

7. **Running Omniverse Applications**
   - Demonstrating how to run Omniverse applications on the virtual workstation, including launching the Omniverse Launcher and connecting to the Enterprise Nucleus Server【67†source】【68†source】.

8. **Hands-On Practice and Troubleshooting**
   - Participants engage in a hands-on session to set up their own cloud workstations, with instructors available for troubleshooting and guidance.

9. **Practical Applications and Future Prospects**
   - Discussing how cloud workstations can be leveraged for complex simulations, large-scale digital twins, and collaborative projects.
   - Exploring future trends in cloud computing and digital twin technology.
