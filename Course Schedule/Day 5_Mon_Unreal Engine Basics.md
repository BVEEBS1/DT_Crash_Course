#### Assignment (End of Day):

- **Task:** Create a small environment in Unreal Engine.
  - Design a scene such as an office space, park, or simple street view.
  - Focus on layout, lighting, and material application to achieve a realistic look.
  - Experiment with a basic interactive element (e.g., a door that opens when approached).

The goal of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with Unreal Engine's fundamental tools and features. It serves as a foundational step in utilizing Unreal Engine for more complex digital twin projects, emphasizing the creation of realistic and interactive environments.
