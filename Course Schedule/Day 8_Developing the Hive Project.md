#### Full Day: Developing the Hive Digital Twin

1. **Understanding the Hive Project**
   - Overview of Hive's operational processes, including the Dematic Multishuttle System, finishing loop, despatch sortation loop, and more.
   - Identifying key digital twin applications, like volume change simulations, cost modeling, bottleneck analysis, and labor planning.

2. **3D Modeling and Omniverse Setup**
   - Creating or refining 3D models in Blender for key components of the Hive fulfilment center.
   - Importing these models into NVIDIA Omniverse and setting up the initial digital twin environment using Omniverseâ€™s USD-based workflow.

3. **Transferring USD Files to Unreal Engine**
   - Exporting the digital twin environment from Omniverse as USD files.
   - Importing USD files into Unreal Engine for further development and enhancement.

4. **Enhancing the Unreal Engine Environment**
   - Developing the environment in Unreal Engine, focusing on high-quality visualization and realistic representation.
   - Implementing advanced lighting, materials, and textures to create an immersive digital twin.

5. **Simulation and Data Integration in Omniverse**
   - Re-importing the enhanced environment back into Omniverse.
   - Integrating real-time data streams, such as WCS and SCADA data, for accurate simulations of operational scenarios.

6. **Simulation Execution and Analysis**
   - Conducting simulations in Omniverse, representing realistic operational conditions and challenges.
   - Analyzing simulation results for insights into efficiency, potential bottlenecks, and operational optimization.

7. **Project Documentation and Presentation**
   - Documenting the development process, including challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
   - Preparing a detailed presentation or report that outlines the functionality and benefits of the Hive digital twin.
