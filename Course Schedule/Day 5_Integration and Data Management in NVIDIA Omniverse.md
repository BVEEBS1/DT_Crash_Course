#### Assignment (End of Day):

- **Task:** Develop a data integration and visualization within Omniverse.
  - Integrate a simple external data source (e.g., a spreadsheet with sensor data) into your Omniverse project.
  - Use this data to influence a simulation or visualization (e.g., changing object colors based on data values).
  - Document the process and results, focusing on data integration, real-time updates, and collaborative aspects.

This assignment is designed to give participants practical experience in handling and visualizing data within Omniverse, a key component in the creation and management of digital twins. It encourages understanding the interplay between data, simulation, and collaboration in a dynamic environment.
