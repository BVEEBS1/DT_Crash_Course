#### Afternoon Session: Introduction to Texturing

1. **Basics of Texturing and UV Mapping**
   - Understanding UV maps and how they relate to texturing.
   - Unwrapping models and editing UV layouts for optimal texture application.

2. **Applying Materials and Textures**
   - Exploring Blender's material system.
   - Applying and tweaking basic materials like metals, plastics, and glass.

3. **Creating and Using Textures**
   - Introduction to image textures and procedural textures.
   - Techniques for applying and layering textures to add realism to models.

4. **Basic Lighting and Rendering for Preview**
   - Setting up simple lighting to enhance the appearance of textures.
   - Rendering previews to evaluate textures and materials.

#### Assignment (End of Day):

- **Task:** Texture the 3D model created in Day 2.
  - Apply at least two different materials to the model.
  - Focus on realistic texturing: consider how light interacts with the material.
  - Render a final image with basic lighting to showcase the textured model.

This assignment is designed to help participants practice the texturing process, an essential skill for creating visually realistic models in digital twin projects. It also encourages them to think critically about material properties and their visual representation in a digital environment.
